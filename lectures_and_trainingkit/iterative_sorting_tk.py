PRECLASS TRAINING KIT

Algorithm: a set of instructions for accomplishing a task
    We want the most efficient algorithm (considering both 'time' and 'space' efficiency)

BIG O NOTATION:
==============
Big O is a way of describing the rate of change in the execution speed when the data size increases. It how we describe how long an algorithm runs and 
    it is a way to compare different algorithms efficiencies.

    The specific terms of Big O notation describe how fast the runtime grows (relative to the size of the input) with a focus on when the input gets very large.

Different computers have different runtimes so by focusing on the general growth, we can avoid the differences in exact runtime betweeen machines and environments.
We also talk about runtime relative to the input size because we need to express our speed in terms of something so we show the speed of the algorithm in terms of
    the input size. This allows us to see how the speed reacts as the input size grows. (we dont care about speed when input size is small)

Constant O(1)           The runtime or space used is completely unaffected by the size of the input; the ideal solution  
Logarithmic O(log n)    As the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used will grow at a slightly slower rate; pretty good solution
Linear O(n)             As the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used will grow at the 'same' rate; generally acceptable solution
Linearithmic O(n log n) As the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used will grow at a slightly faster rate; usable but might not be an ideal solution
Polynomial O(n^c)       As the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used will grow at a faster rate; solutin may work for handful of small inputs but is in no way scalable
Exponential O(c^n)      As the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used will grow at a much faster rate; a pretty inefficient solution
Factorial O(n!)         As the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used will grows at astronomically, even with relatively small inputs; extremely slow solution

So when we talk about the complexity of a function, we usually assume the "worst case", which is if the 'thing' was last in this case, O(n)

Note: 
    Big theta gives both an upper and lower bound for the running time.
    Big O only gives an upperbound

DO constants ever matter?

Just because two algos have the same Big O notation doesnt mean they are equal

Example: suppose you have a script that takes 1 hour to run. 
         -By improving the function,you can divide that runtime by six and now it only takes 10 minutes to run.

"""BINARY SEARCH
On average, its best to take the middle or average (example: guessing a number 1-1000)
    You start at 500 and ask if too high or too low - then repeat each time halving it

LOGARITHMS:
----------
The situation where you are halving the number of possibilities each time, mathematically, is considered a logarithm

Logs:  10^2 = 100 means 10 multiplied by itself 2 times equals 100
       log10(100) = 2 is the inverse of above, means how many 10s would we have to multiply to equal 100, the answer is 2
    
Halving numbers each time, like in Binary search, is log2(n), just like if we doubled numbers each time, it's n^2.
Whenver we talk about logarithms in relation to describing the runtime of an algorithm, we are talking about log2(n)

When we talk about logarithms in computing, we almost always mean log2() because computers operate on binary or a base 2 number system.

""" SELECTION SORT 
    ==============

Sorting helps make searching and finding a specific item easier. 

out-of-place selection sort:
---------------------------
Book example:
    We want to sort books on a shelf alphabetically by title starting on the left
    Most natural way would be to scan the books from left to right, looking for book title with lowest alphabetical title
    We find "Animal Farm" and take that book and place it all the way to the left
    Now we go through the books again, looking for the next book with the lowest alphabetical title
    We repeat this until the books are all sorted

    This worked because we had a lot of room on our shelf but what if there is no extra room? Then we need to sort the books in-place.
    That means instead of creating a new collection of books we need to swap books as we encounter them.


In-place selection sort:
-----------------------
Book example again:
    Start by looking through each book from left to right, keeping track of the lowest book we find.
    Once we find it, "Animal Farm", we swap the lowest book with the first position.
    We repeat this whole process but we start at the second position and will swap the lowest book with the second position when we find it
    During this loop, the book in second position is already "lowest" book so no swapping takes place
    We repeat this process now starting at the third position.
    Each time we loop through we increment our starting position by 1 until we get to the last position in the collection
"""

""" INSERTION SORT
    ==============

Insertion sort is an efficient algorithm for sorting 'small amounts' of data

PLaying cards example:
    When you sort cards, you start with an empty left hand then take one card at a time from a pile of cards that is face down on the table.
    With each card you pick up, you insert it into the correct position in the left hand
    To do so, you compare the current card to each card already in the left hand, starting at the rightmost card.
    If the current card is smaller, you swap positions
    You keep doing this while the current card is smaller than the card on the left
    Once the current card is not smaller than card on the left, you can stop and pick up a new card

Complexity analysis:
    Insertion sort runs in O(n) time  in it's best case
                   runs in O(n^2) time in its worst and average cases

    If the colletion is already sorted, the insertion sort algorithm will still have to go through each item in the collection to make sure
        its in the right spot.
    The worst case would be if the collection was sorted in descending order. This would require us to do the maximum number of iterations to
        shift items to the right and will be O(n^2)
    For the average case, the number of inner loops will not be the maximum but since constants do not matter, it will still be O(n^2)
"""

"""BUBBLE SORT
   ===========

Bubble sort is one of the simplest but very inefficient algorithms.

Described by:
    1. Compare the first and second item of a collection. If the first item is bigger than the second item, swap the items
    2. Move to the next item. Compare the 2nd item with the 3rd item, if 2nd is bigger then swap them
    3. Do this for every item until the end of the list
    4. Repeat steps 1-3(decrementing "the end of the list" by 1 each time)

Complexity Analysis:
    Even if the list is already sorted, we still have to touch every item in the list. 
    That means the best case has an O(n) runtime complexity (where only the outer loop runs)
    In the worst case, the inner loop has to perform 1/2 * n operations due to swapping every element
    Remembering we drop constants in the Big O notiation, this means that the entire algorithm's complexity (inner and outer loop) can 
        be represented in Big O with O(n*n) or O(n^2)

The Big O for the outer loop is O(n) since we are going through each item in our data
Each time our outer loop increments, our inner loop decreases by 1. On average, we check a list of 1/2 x n
