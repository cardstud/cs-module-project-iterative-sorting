""" Getting the time complexity of an iterative solution
1. Compute the Big-O for each line in isolation
2. If something is in a loop, multiply it's Big-O by the loop for the total
3. If two things happen sequentially, add the Big-O
4. Drop Leading multiplicative constants from each Big-O
5. From all the Big-Os that are added, drop all but the biggest, dominating one

    1. This gets bad quickly, but a computer can normally handle an n of a few hundred
    2. It's easy to confuse this with exponential time. The difference here is that the number
            grows but the exponent stays the same
    3. The keywords for polynomial are pairs, triplets, etc. Sometimes you have to get this - find ...?
    4. One point of algorithms and data structures is to improve solutions that have this runtime or worse

""" LINEAR SEARCH

Key points:
-----------
1. Linear search is the simplest of search we can do
2. Sometimes it's the only method available. If the data is unordered, this is the only way to do it
3. It also beats a binary search under some special circumstances
4. Key words: unsorted, random

    if we want to search for a 2 in this dataset using a linear search:
        Check 0, is that a 2 - no, ok move to next one
        Check 7, is that a 2 - no, ok move to next one
        Check 4, is that a 2 - no, ok move to next one
        Check 2, is that a 2 - yes, i found it, return the index or just say yes, there is a 2 there
    if we want to find a 12, need to go through the whole thing to find it, then ret index or say yes its there
    if we want to find a 42, we need to go through whole thing to find out its not in there

""" SORTING DATA

Lets say we have a python list of numbers that we want to sort: (sorting in general)

    my_list = [8,2,5,4,1,3]

We can start just by arbitrarily that the left side is sorted, and that the number there is already sorted.
We can do this by definition, one element_is_sorted. 
There are no other configurations to put the data in.

I'll mark this example by adding some space, but to the computer, there is still just a normal array

    my_list = [8,   2,5,4,1,3]

The next step is to look at the first element in the unsorted side and determine where it goes.
If it's greater than that, it stays in the same place. If not, we move it left 1 box.

If it's larger, or it's now the first index, we've found it's home. 
Otherwise, we continue with the same process

2 is less than 8, so we pop the 2 out to a temp variable, move the 8 to the right.

    my_list = [8,   2,5,4,1,3]
    my_list = [8,   8,5,4,1,3]

Then we determine if the two goes in the 8's old spot.
What are the two rules? If it's bigger or at the first element. 
So the 2 is now up front and the first two elements are sorted

    my_list = [2,8  5,4,1,3]

We continue the process with the 5, its less than 8 but greater than 2

    my_list = [2,5,8    4,1,3]

From here, we go element by element, until all the elements are on the sorted side

----------
1. A problem with a defined start and end point lends itself to an iterative solution
2. Management of iteration is key to solving this problem
